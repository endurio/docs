The Endurio Protocol operates as a collection of smart contracts on the Arbitrum blockchain, enabling unrestricted interaction and development of clients and bots.

As part of its contribution, the Endurio team has introduced a **Telegram Miner Bot**. However, this is not the sole means of engaging with the protocol. The community is encouraged to create and share enhanced interfaces and tools to further expand the protocol's ecosystem.
