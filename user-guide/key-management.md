# Key Management

There are two ways for Endurio Miner to use and protect the miner's private key, starting from the Settings dialog above.

### Import Wallet

The miner's private key can be imported from external crypto wallet apps such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or SafePal. This method is the safest, as the private key cannot be exported from the Endurio Miner MiniApp. However, it is more complex, requiring users to install and manage crypto wallet applications, making it best suited for experienced users.

### Export Wallet

When the Telegram Miner MiniApp is opened for the first time, a private key is generated and securely stored in the Telegram cloud. It remains safe as long as you maintain access to your Telegram account. This method is much simpler, as new users do not need to manage crypto wallet apps. The Endurio Miner MiniApp is carefully designed to handle all crypto-related tasks of a wallet seamlessly.

However, there is always a risk of a user's Telegram account being banned, and account recovery is not an easy task. To mitigate this, the Endurio Miner MiniApp allows users to export their private key for backup. This option is available only if the user's device is protected by biometric security, such as fingerprint or Face ID.

This feature is also only available for the default private key generated by the Endurio Miner MiniApp itself, not for keys imported by the user.
