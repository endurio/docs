# Endurio

Every Bitcoin transaction can be sent with memo text in an OP\_RET output. This memo can be used to promote user brand in everyday transactions.

The Endurio Protocol is designed to create an incentive for Bitcoin users to include a small memo into their everyday transactions to promote any brand paid in the market.
