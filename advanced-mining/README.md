# Advanced Mining

In times of intense competition, when too many miners are mining the same block, miners can increase their reward share by either lowering their success chance (x-mining) and/or providing an additional branding service (bounty hunting).

However, these tools do not increase the total reward of a block, so they have no effect if you are the sole miner of that block.
