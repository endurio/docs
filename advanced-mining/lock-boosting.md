# Lock Boosting

When relaying a transaction, a miner can choose to lock a portion of their reward in a savings contract for a selected duration, up to a maximum of two years. The unlocked portion can be claimed immediately as usual, while the locked portion accrues a boost based on the length of the lock period. The longer the lock duration, the greater the boost upon unlocking.

Referral commissions will be calculated based on the minerâ€™s total boosted reward, incentivizing referrals while aligning rewards with long-term participation.
