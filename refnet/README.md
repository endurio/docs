# Referral Network

Referral Network (RefNet) is a referral affiliate network represented as a forest data structure.

Each node can refer to a parent node. A node without a parent is considered a root node. Root nodes do not gain any additional benefits compared to nodes with a parent and miss out on the following advantages:

* **Social and Technical Support** from ancestor nodes.
* **Commission Feedback**: An upcoming feature that allows parent nodes to share a portion of their commission with their descendants.

The parent node reference is permanent and cannot be changed or removed.
