# Claiming

After the relaying time is over, each relayed transaction can be claimed anytime by its miner. The miner is the Ethereum account that shares the same key pair with the sender address of the mining transaction.

For example, any transactions sent by `tb1q49239d5pwn63cqhmnnfgu8z6ndzah7dycgcfql` can be claimed by its miner address `0x2222A917A5Fc6A35166346c69402f5677Ce51205` because they belong to the same public key below:
